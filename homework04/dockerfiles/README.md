# Analyzing Mar's Rover's Collected Data
The purpose of this project is to read in a JSON file of the collected data, analyze it, and determine if the water is safe for sample testing. It determines this based off the 5 most recent data points. This project enhances my skills with JSON manipulation, huge list manipulation, Python organization, documentation, logging, unit testing, and more.
